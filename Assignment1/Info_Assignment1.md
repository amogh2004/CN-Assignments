# All the information regarding Question A08
**STATUS CODE 200** </br>
This class of status codes indicates the action requested by the client was received, understood and accepted. 200 OK. Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used.</br></br>
**STATUS CODE 301** </br>
A status code of 301 tells a client that the resource they asked for has permanently moved to a new location. The response should also include this location. It tells the client to use the new URL the next time it wants to fetch the same resource.</br></br>
**STATUS CODE 302** </br>
HTTP 302. The HTTP response status code 302 Found is a common way of performing URL redirection. ... This is an invitation to the user agent (e.g. a web browser) to make a second, otherwise identical, request to the new URL specified in the location field. The end result is a redirection to the new URL.</br></br>
**STATUS CODE 304**</br>
304 Not Modified is an HTTP status code that is returned to the client when the cached copy of a particular file is up to date with the server. When a client such as a browser stores something in cache, it also keeps the Last-Modified header sent from the server.</br></br>
**STATUS CODE 400**</br>
The 400 Bad Request error is an HTTP status code that means that the request you sent to the website server, often something simple like a request to load a web page, was somehow incorrect or corrupted and the server couldn't understand it.</br></br>
**STATUS CODE 403**</br>
The 403 (Forbidden) status code indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. A server that wishes to make public why the request has been forbidden can describe that reason in the response payload (if any).</br></br>
**STATUS CODE 404**</br> 
The HTTP 404, 404 Not Found, 404, Page Not Found, or Server Not Found error message is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol standard response code, in computer network communications, to indicate that the browser was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested.</br></br>
**WEB CLIENT**</br>
The Web Client is a client-side component within the Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE), a distributed multi-tiered application model used for building and developing enterprise applications. Client-side components are typically computer applications running on a user's computer and connect to a server. These components perform client-side operations as they might need access to information available only on the client side, like user input, or because the server lacks the processing power necessary in such operations.</br></br>
**WEB PAGE**</br>
A web page is a document commonly written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) that is accessible through the Internet or other networks using an Internet Browser. A web page is accessed by entering a URL address and may contain text, graphics, and hyperlinks to other web pages and files. The page you are reading now is an example of a web page.</br></br>
**WEB SERVER**</br>
Web server is a program that uses HTTP to serve files that create webpages to users in response to their requests, which is sent by their computers HTTP connection. Any server that delivers an XML document to another device can be a web server. A better definition might be that a web server is an Internet server that responds to HTTP requests to deliver content and services.</br></br>
**URL** </br>
A uniform resource locator (URL) is the address of a resource on the Internet. A URL indicates the location of a resource as well as the protocol used to access it.</br>
A URL contains the following information:</br>
a)The protocol used to a access the resource</br>
b)The the location of the server (whether by IP address or domain name)</br>
c)The port number on the server (optional)</br>
d)The location of the resource in the directory structure of the server</br>
e)A fragment identifier (optional)</br></br>
**TCPDUMP OF COMMUNICATION**</br>
tcpdump is a common packet analyzer that runs under the command line. It allows the user to display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is attached. tcpdump prints the contents of network packets. It can read packets from a network interface card or from a previously created saved packet file. tcpdump can write packets to standard output or a file.</br></br>
**HTTP**</br>
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the set of rules for transferring files, such as text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files, on the World Wide Web. As soon as a Web user opens their Web browser, the user is indirectly making use of HTTP. HTTP is an application protocol that runs on top of the TCP/IP suite of protocols (the foundation protocols for the Internet). The latest version of HTTP is HTTP/2, which was published in May 2015.</br>
How HTTP works:-</br>
As the Hypertext part of the name implies, HTTP concepts include the idea that files can contain references to other files whose selection will elicit additional transfer requests. In addition to the Web page files it can serve, any Web server machine contains an HTTP daemon, a program that is designed to wait for HTTP requests and handle them when they arrive. A Web browser is an HTTP client, sending requests to server machines. When the browser user enters file requests by either "opening" a Web file (typing in a URL) or clicking on a hypertext link, the browser builds an HTTP request and sends it to the Internet Protocol address (IP address) indicated by the URL. The HTTP daemon in the destination server machine receives the request and sends back the requested file or files associated with the request.</br></br>
