## Challenges<br><br>
The challenge faced during completion of the assignment was regarding "Rate Limiting". Implementation of concept Rate Limiting was not easy, since we had to make function a task, and then put all the tasks in a list, which inturn had to be passed as a parameter to the Rate Limiter function. We failed to implement Rate Limiter, but the given aim was reached using simple Multithreading concepts, which uses run(), start(), sleep() methods.
